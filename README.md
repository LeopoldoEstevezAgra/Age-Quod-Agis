Age Quod Agis
========================

**What is it ? **: 

Age Quod Agis is an agenda-like app developed using the Symfony framework 
heavily inspired on the well known "Bullet Journals".

The main focus of this app is to create a clear and simple way to managed our time.

**Why something like this ? **: 

At first this was a project to be presented the last test of a 2 year vocational
study course centered on Multiplatform App Development but, after that, I decided 
to keep developing this web.
